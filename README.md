This project is a browser‑based fusion ignition calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore the conditions required for deuterium–tritium (D–T) fusion ignition using the Bosch–Hale parametrization for realistic reactivity.

No more guesswork — the simulator shows whether a chosen plasma configuration meets the ignition threshold, and provides reaction rate and fusion power density estimates.

Reaction Rate & Power Density: Calculates collisions per cubic meter per second and resulting fusion power density.

Clean Interface: Styled with a dark theme and neon accents for clarity and readability.

Educational Output: Displays ignition status, reactivity, reaction rate, and power density in easy‑to‑read format.

How to Use
